        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        
        <div class="meta">
            <strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 16, 2025<br>
            <strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 16, 2025
        </div>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Smartin. By downloading, accessing, or using the Smartin mobile application (the "App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>
        <p>These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Smartin ("we," "us," or "our"). We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms.</p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>Smartin is a stock analysis tool that provides:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stock screening and analysis based on fundamental investment principles</li>
            <li>Educational content about investing</li>
            <li>Entertainment features incorporating fictional character commentary</li>
            <li>Information derived from third-party financial data providers</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Entertainment Features:</strong> The App includes a "Character Commentary" feature that uses fictional character archetypes for entertainment purposes. Any financial views expressed by these fictional characters are satirical and should never be used as a basis for investment decisions. This feature is exclusively for entertainment and is completely separate from the App's analytical functions.</p>
        
        <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Smartin is NOT:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A registered investment advisor</li>
            <li>A broker-dealer or financial institution</li>
            <li>A source of personalized financial advice</li>
            <li>A trading platform or execution service</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Not Financial Advice</h2>
        <div class="important">
            <strong>THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION. READ CAREFULLY.</strong>
        </div>

        <h3>3.1 Educational, Informational, and Entertainment Purpose</h3>
        <p>All content, analysis, scores, and information provided through the App is for educational, informational, and entertainment purposes only. The App combines investment analysis with entertainment features (including fictional character commentary) to make financial education more accessible and engaging.</p>
        
        <div class="algorithm-note">
            <strong>Smartin Scores:</strong> Smartin Scores are generated by automated algorithms based on publicly available historical data and fundamental analysis principles. These scores do not reflect qualitative market conditions, insider information, or real-time events. A high score is NOT a recommendation to buy, and a low score is NOT a recommendation to sell. Scores are tools to assist your own research, not replace it.
        </div>
        
        <p>Nothing in the App constitutes:</p>
        <ul>
