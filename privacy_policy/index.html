      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Effective date: <strong>December 17, 2025</strong></p>
      <p>Smartin App</p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information the <strong>Smartin</strong> mobile app collects, how it is used, and your choices. This policy applies to the Smartin app distributed through the Apple App Store.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Smartin does not require you to create an account or provide personal information such as your name, email address, or financial account data. However, when you use the app, certain technical data may be collected automatically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device model, operating system version, and app version for compatibility and debugging purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> Anonymous interaction data (such as features used and session duration) to help us improve the app experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> Technical diagnostics when errors occur, to help us fix bugs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Log Data and Network Requests</h2>
    <p>When you use features that require internet access (such as fetching stock market data), our servers and third-party data providers automatically log standard technical information, including your IP address and the time of the request. This data is used solely for service delivery, security, and debugging purposes. We do not use this information to identify you personally.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
    <p>Smartin uses third-party services to operate, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Market Data Providers:</strong> To fetch stock information. When you request stock data, your IP address may be processed by their servers.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> To manage subscription purchases through Apple's App Store.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics Services:</strong> To collect anonymous usage data and crash reports for app improvement.</li>
      <li><strong>Cloud Infrastructure:</strong> To support backend functionality and data storage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These providers process data only as necessary to deliver their services and are bound by their own privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>4. How We Use Collected Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Deliver stock analysis features and app functionality.</li>
      <li>Improve app stability and performance (crash reports).</li>
      <li>Understand general usage patterns to improve the product.</li>
      <li>Process and manage subscription purchases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent user data. We do not share personal data with third parties for marketing purposes. Data is shared only with the service providers listed above, solely to operate the app and provide its features.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We do not maintain persistent user accounts or store personal profiles on our servers. Analytics data is retained in accordance with our third-party providers' policies (typically 90 days for crash reports). Server logs containing IP addresses are retained for a limited period for security purposes and then deleted.</p>

    <h2>7. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <p>This app does not use cookie-based tracking or cross-app advertising identifiers.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p><strong>California Residents (CCPA/CPRA):</strong> You have the right to know what personal information is collected, request deletion, and opt out of the sale of personal information. We do not sell personal information. To exercise your rights, contact us at the email below.</p>
    <p><strong>European Union and UK Residents (GDPR):</strong> You have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we hold. You also have the right to data portability and to object to processing. Since we do not store personal accounts, our ability to identify specific user data is limited, but please contact us for assistance with any privacy requests.</p>

    <h2>9. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect any data we process. However, no system is completely secure – we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>10. Children</h2>
    <p>Smartin is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy. When we do, we will update the Effective Date above. If the changes are material, we will make an effort to notify users in the app or via the App Store listing.</p>

    <h2>12. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions, concerns, or requests about this policy or your data, contact us at: contact@smartinthe.app</p>
